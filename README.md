# Description
Linear, Bilinear and Trilinear Interpolation for any dimensional vectors with an example use in averaging colors in RGBA and OkLab color spaces.

Running the `make_video.sh` will turn the images into a video or a gif that showcases the interpolation. Above is showcased a gif made from interpolating 100 steps in each direction. The quality of the video is higher.
